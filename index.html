Hello everyone! My name is Michael Scarazza, I am current student at Delaware County Community College pursuing the degree of web development.

I work at an Amazon fulfilment center currently, I thoroughly enjoy playing video games, and relaxing with my girlfriend whether that be just watching tv or going out on a hike.

I will be posting my future projects on this site, I am excited to learn more on this journey!
